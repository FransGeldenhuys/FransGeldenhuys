- 👋 Hi, I’m @FransGeldenhuys
- 👀 I’m interested in Data analytics and data sets
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Data Analytics and business inteligence 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on data sets to start a new career and gain knowledge and experience.

- I am open-minded, often coming up with new and interesting ideas. I enjoy novelty and change and avoid routine as much as possible. I am highly adaptable and open to experience. As a Hands-on Learner I approach problem-solving with my preference to rely on my experience to find solutions; sometimes adding to this approach, an analysis of the situation. I enjoy finding more practical solutions to problems and believe that the best learning comes from experience, while also seeing where research may still have its place. I enjoy meeting new people, making contacts and helping your network. My ability to read and influence others means that I am comfortable in most social situations. I am confident and determined to produce work that's consistently strong. I have a sense of competition that motivates me, I value the respect of my peers.
